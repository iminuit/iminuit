Tutorials
=========

All the tutorials are in tutorial directory. You can view them online too:

- `Basic tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/iminuit/iminuit/master/tutorial/tutorial.ipynb>`_
- `Advanced tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/iminuit/iminuit/master/tutorial/advanced_tutorial.ipynb>`_
- `Hard Core Cython tutorial <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.github.com/iminuit/iminuit/master/tutorial/hard-core-tutorial.ipynb>`_.
  If you need to do a huge likelihood fit that needs speed, this is for you.
  If you don't care, just use `probfit`_.
  It's a fun read though I think.
